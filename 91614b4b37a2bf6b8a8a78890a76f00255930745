      "message": "How do you automerge a change if its parents are out of date?\n\ni.e. I upload patches 1,2,3,4,5 in a stack, then update patches 1 and 3 with a second patchset (we\u0027ll refer to that as 1\u0027,3\u0027). Patchset 5 still has 1,2,3,4,5 in its history as it wasn\u0027t updated. Patchset 4 still has 1,2,3,4 in its history. Patchset 3 has 1\u0027,3\u0027 in its history. Patchset 2 should not be included, but has 1,2 in its history. Patchset 1 is updated and has 1\u0027. What we want to be merge created is 1\u0027,3\u0027,4\u0027,5\u0027 (where 4\u0027 and 5\u0027 are the rebases autocreated when you submit the patch)",
